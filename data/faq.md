### Can I move or resize the UnitFrames?
The UnitFrames can be moved and scaled as you like.

0. Hold ctrl down and click on the top edge to move it.
1. Find a corner and you'll see the rescaling arrows.

### Actionbars are not showing up
Check that you haven't disabled ActionBars by pressing ESC -> HUD and check Skills. It should be Always on.*

### Inventory window is too small
NOOOOOOOOOO! Oh wait... you can resize it from the top or bottom left corner.

### Other Addons won't work with VikinghugUI installed
This happens if other addons calls the normal UI addons. Like Datachron calling QuestTracker. When other addons then call these by their "Carbine Name" and you have VikingUI installed they can't find each other. A solution could be to make the addon know you have VikingUI Installed and call the VikingName. This does require some knowledge of Lua and Wildstar addons.

We will later on try and work out how to support other addons.

### The Downloader only downloads some of the folders
Make sure your firewall is allowing it to download. Some firewalls might block it.

### How do I change color?
You can change UnitFrame colors from the VikingSettings.
